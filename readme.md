# Node.js Internship Projects – Cognifyz Technologies

This repository contains the completed tasks assigned during my internship at Cognifyz Technologies (Ref: CTI/A1/C177958).

## About

As part of this internship, I worked on multiple Node.js-based web development tasks. These projects were designed to strengthen my skills in server-side development, EJS templating, form validation, CRUD operations, REST APIs, and MySQL database integration.

## Project Structure

Each task is organized into a separate folder under this repository. All tasks share common dependencies defined in the package.json file and follow best practices for modular and maintainable code.

## List of Completed Tasks

1. Task 1 – Basic form handling and server setup using Express.js
2. Task 2 – Enhanced form validation and UI interactivity
3. Task 3 – Password validation with DOM manipulation
4. Task 4 – Simulated page routing with client-side logic
5. Task 5 – RESTful API integration with MySQL and dynamic dashboard
6. Task 6 – Authentication system including login, register, logout, and forgot password features
7. Task 7 – Dashboard redesign with CSS styling and background animation

## What I Learned

- Setting up and structuring Node.js applications using Express.js
- Implementing client-side and server-side form validation
- Handling session-based authentication in Node.js
- Using EJS templates to render dynamic pages
- Performing CRUD operations using RESTful APIs
- Integrating MySQL database with backend logic
- Organizing code and managing dependencies using Git and GitHub
- Designing responsive front-end interfaces with CSS and animations
